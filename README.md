## description of project ##

This app is a online flower store. The user who has an admin role (in real life, the admin would be a staff) would be able to upload 1 image of a flower arrangement everyday. Users(guests or shoppers) will be able to view that image and decide if they want to order that particular flower. If they are interested they go ahead and make a purchase and if not, they wait to see if they like the flowers the next day, so on and so forth.



## how to ##

 1. Fork and clone this app locally
 2. Run `bundle install`
 3. Run `rake db:migrate`
 4. Run `rake db:seed`
 5. Run `rails s`
 6. Click the link given for the IP address or localhost to start exploring
 7. Now sign in using the admin email: `vanita112003@gmail.com` and password : `2801744`
 8. Once you are in signed in, you will be able to view the store just like any guest would. Only difference is you get to add the 'flower of the day'. Go ahead and create the your flower. This is an important step to do or else, the website is not functional.
 9. Once you are done exploring, feel free to sign out and try viewing the website as a guest user. Not much of a difference honestly.. So you could just do all your exploring as an admin.
